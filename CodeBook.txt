Study Design
===================
The data contained in the file Out_mean.table.txt is a summary of the 
measurement s collected by Davide Anguita et al [1].

In this summarized dateset, rows are ordered by subject and activity.
It contains, all together, the train and test data.

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age
bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities 
(WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded
accelerometer and gyroscope, researches captured 3-axial linear acceleration and
3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been
video-recorded to label the data manually.

Code Book
===================
The first two columns of the resulting dataset identify the subject, with an
integer from 1 to 30, and the six activities with its unique label.

The remaining columns are the average of the mean and standard deviation of the
collected signals, grouped by subject and by activity.

We appended the expression ".Grand" to the variable names, indicating that these
new variables are the averages of the mean and standard deviation of those
collected signals, calculated by subjects and activity. Furthermore, the variable
names look slightly different from the raw dataset, due to the option 
`check.names = TRUE`, from the `read.table` function. When this option is 
enabled, R checks that the variable names are syntactically valid, and adjusts if
necessary.

Since the signals were collected with a 50 Hz frequency, resulting in a enormous
amount of raw data, it becomes difficult to study the effects of the factors
subject and activity. 

Summarizing it with the averages of the mean and standard deviation enables us to
easily compare the magnitudes of the signals according to the activity and the
subject.

The variables contained in the Out_mean.table.txt file are listed bellow.
Raw acceleration signals from the smartphone accelerometer X axis are in standard 
gravity units 'g'

Raw angular velocity signals, measured by the gyroscope, are in expressed in 
radian/second.

For this assignment, we did not make use of raw acceleration or angular velocity 
variables. Instead, we made our summaries on the feature vectors, that were previously
normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
